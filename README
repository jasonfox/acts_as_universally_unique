ActsAsUniversallyUnique
=======================

This plugin adds a UUID field to the models that acts_as_universally_unique. 
This plugin relies on the UUID gem: http://github.com/assaf/uuid/tree/master. 
You can read more about UUIDs here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uuid.

Please note that the UUID gem maintains a state file which is created in 
/var/tmp/ruby-uuid or the Windows common application data directory using mode 
0644. If that directory is not writable, the file is created as .ruby-uuid in 
the home directory. State files are not portable across machines. For more
information see: http://github.com/assaf/uuid/tree/master.

                :urn      => 'urn:uuid:%08x-%04x-%04x-%04x-%012x'
